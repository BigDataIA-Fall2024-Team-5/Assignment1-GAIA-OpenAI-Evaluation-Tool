# Streamlit Pages

This folder contains the individual pages that make up the user interface of the OpenAI Evaluation App, built using **Streamlit**. Each page corresponds to a different functionality within the app.

## Files

- **explore_questions.py**: 
  - This page allows users to explore the questions in the GAIA dataset. Users can select a question, view the associated file (if available), and send the question to ChatGPT for evaluation. The results are then displayed on this page.
  
- **view_summary.py**: 
  - This page provides a summary of the evaluation results, visualized using **Matplotlib**. Users can view a bar chart showing the distribution of correct and incorrect answers, along with detailed counts of the evaluation results.

Each page is designed to give users a smooth interface to interact with the dataset and evaluate the questions using ChatGPT.
